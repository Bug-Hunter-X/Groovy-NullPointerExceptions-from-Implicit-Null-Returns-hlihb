This example demonstrates a common issue in Groovy where methods implicitly returning null can cause unexpected NullPointerExceptions. The `myMethod` example showcases a method that returns null when the input parameter is null. This is fine in isolation, but when the output is used without a null check, the `anotherMethod` call throws a NullPointerException. The solution shows how to handle this via explicit null checks, providing better robustness.
